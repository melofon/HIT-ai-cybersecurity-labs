# Lab 1 — Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Report Mapping to MITRE ATT&CK

## 🎯 Goal
Work in groups.  
Choose a real-world Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) report, analyze the described attack, and map its behaviors to **MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques**.

By the end of the course, this lab must be included in your **group GitHub repository**.  
**Do not send files by email.**  
All results must be submitted as **Markdown (`.md`) files**, not Word or PDF.
