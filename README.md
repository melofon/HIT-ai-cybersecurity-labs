# AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity — Laboratory Assignments

Hands-on labs for the AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity course, covering MITRE ATT&CK mapping, AI-driven threat detection, accelerated pipelines, and real-world security data

This repository contains the practical laboratory component of the **AI-Enhanced Cybersecurity** course designed by  
**Dr. Andrei Kojukhov** and **Viacheslav Nefedov** (HIT, Israel).  

The labs focus on understanding how **AI techniques, accelerated pipelines, and modern data workflows** are applied in real cybersecurity scenarios.  
Students work with **real threat reports**, **security logs**, **network data**, and **NLP-based threat examples**, gradually building practical skills needed in SOC, CTI, and AI-driven detection environments.

## 🎯 Course Focus

The full course provides a structured introduction to:

- The modern cybersecurity landscape and threat actors  
- The **MITRE ATT&CK** framework and its use in CTI analysis  
- Types of cybersecurity data: logs, flows, email, user activity  
- Data processing workflows and **streaming/accelerated pipelines** (Kafka, RAPIDS, Morpheus)  
- AI models for:
  - log anomaly detection  
  - phishing & email classification  
  - insider-threat detection  
  - network anomaly detection  
- Model deployment concepts (Triton, ONNX, GPU inference)  
- Explainable AI (xAI) for cybersecurity  
- Security of AI models (LLM attacks, adversarial behavior)

This repository includes only **the laboratory assignments**, not full lecture content.
